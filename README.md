## 🚀 Industrial Engineer + Manager = Developer in the Making

I'm an insatiable curious mind with an appetite for knowledge. My motto: "A bit of everything, but everything with passion".

### 🛠️ My Toolbox (constantly expanding):

- 🌐 HTML, CSS, JS (Building the web, one <div> at a time!)
- 🐙 Git & GitHub (Because sharing is caring, and commits are my diary)
- 🎨 Figma (Designing experiences, not just interfaces)
- 📊 Tableau & Power BI (Turning data into visual stories)
- 🔧 Power Platform (Exploring the power of automation)

### 🌱 Currently growing:

- React/Angular (Because the future is component by component)
- Tailwind/Sass (Styling with superpowers)

### 💼 Multifaceted experience:

- Data analysis across 3 different companies (Yes, I like numbers as much as coffee)
- Project management (Taming chaos and delivering results)
- Industrial processes and materials (Every industrial engineer has a bit of an alchemist inside)

### 🌟 Personal mission:

To inspire through innovative ideas and projects, while contributing to society with my diverse knowledge. I'm seeking a job that not only feeds my career but also my soul.

### 🎭 Beyond the code:

- Finance (Because numbers are my second language)
- Information management (Taming the digital chaos)
- Continuous learning (Curiosity is my superpower)

PS: If you're reading this, you probably should hire me. I'm as versatile as a Swiss Army knife, but much more fun in team meetings. 😉
